# lazycoding 🛋️

[English](../README.md) · [简体中文](docs/README.zh-CN.md)

**Control a local Claude Code session from your phone — over Telegram or Feishu (Lark).**

Write code, fix bugs, and manage multiple projects — all by sending a message. lazycoding runs on your machine, bridges Telegram to the `claude` CLI, and streams every tool call and response back to your chat in real time.

```
You (anywhere, any device)
        │  "refactor the auth module and add tests"
        ▼
   Telegram  ─or─  Feishu (Lark)
        │
        ▼
   lazycoding  ← runs on your dev machine
        │  claude --print --output-format stream-json
        ▼
   Claude Code  ← reads files, runs commands, writes code
        │
        ▼
   Streaming output → back to your chat in real time
```

## Why lazycoding?

**Claude Code is powerful but tied to a terminal.** lazycoding removes that constraint.

| Without lazycoding | With lazycoding |
|--------------------|-----------------|
| Must be at your computer | Works from your phone, tablet, or any Telegram client |
| One project per session | One bot serves multiple projects simultaneously |
| Manual session management | Sessions persist across restarts; context is never lost |
| No voice input | Dictate tasks hands-free |
| Files stay local | Send/receive files directly in chat |

**Ideal for:**
- Reviewing a PR on your phone and having Claude apply the fixes
- Dictating a feature spec during a commute and watching Claude implement it
- Sharing a Claude-powered coding assistant with your team over a group chat
- Running long tasks in the background and getting notified when they complete

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Notes |
|------------|-------|
| Go 1.21+ | Build only; the compiled binary has no runtime dependencies |
| `claude` CLI | Must be logged in — `claude --version` should work |
| Telegram Bot Token | Obtain from @BotFather (free, takes 2 minutes) |
| Feishu Bot Credentials | Optional — App ID + App Secret from [open.feishu.cn](https://open.feishu.cn) |

Verify the Claude CLI works:

```bash
claude --version
claude --print "hello" --output-format stream-json --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

---

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/bishenghua/lazycoding.git
cd lazycoding
make build

# 2. Create your config
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml: set telegram.token, allowed_user_ids, and claude.work_dir

# 3. Run
./lazycoding config.yaml

# 4. Open Telegram, send your bot a message — Claude starts working
```

---

## Build

```bash
# Standard build (recommended)
go build -o lazycoding ./cmd/lazycoding/

# With embedded whisper.cpp voice recognition (requires brew install whisper-cpp)
go build -tags whisper -o lazycoding ./cmd/lazycoding/

# Cross-compile for all platforms → dist/
make release
```

Available `make` targets:

```
make build          build for current platform
make build-whisper  build with CGo whisper voice recognition
make test           run tests
make release        cross-compile: linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64, darwin/arm64, windows/amd64
make clean          remove build artefacts
```

---

## Step 1 – Create a Telegram bot

1. Open Telegram → search **@BotFather** → send `/newbot`
2. Follow the prompts; BotFather gives you a token like `1234567890:ABCdef…`
3. Copy the token into `config.yaml` → `telegram.token`

---

## Step 2 – Basic configuration

```bash
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
# Edit config.yaml
```

Minimum working config:

```yaml
telegram:
  token: "1234567890:ABCdefGHIjklMNOpqrsTUVwxyz"
  allowed_user_ids:
    - 123456789   # your Telegram user_id

claude:
  work_dir: "/Users/yourname/projects/my-project"
  timeout_sec: 900

log:
  format: "text"
  level: "info"
```

**Find your user\_id:** message **@userinfobot** on Telegram; the reply contains your `Id`.

---

## Step 3 – Find your chat\_id

Each conversation has a unique `chat_id`, used when mapping multiple projects.

### Using /workdir (recommended)

1. Start the bot: `./lazycoding config.yaml`
2. Send `/workdir` in the target conversation
3. Read the conversation id from the terminal log:
   ```
   level=INFO msg="request started" conversation=-1001234567890 ...
   ```

### chat\_id patterns

| Value | Conversation type |
|-------|------------------|
| Positive integer, e.g. `123456789` | Your DM with the bot |
| Negative integer, e.g. `-1001234567890` | Group / supergroup / channel |

> ⚠️ Negative chat\_ids **must be quoted** in YAML: `"-1001234567890":`

---

## Step 4 – Map conversations to projects

```yaml
channels:

  # Your DM with the bot → personal project
  "123456789":
    work_dir: "/Users/yourname/projects/personal"

  # Team group → shared backend project
  "-1001234567890":
    work_dir: "/Users/yourname/projects/backend-api"

  # Another group → different project, stronger model
  "-1009876543210":
    work_dir: "/Users/yourname/projects/ml-research"
    extra_flags:
      - "--model"
      - "claude-opus-4-6"
```

Unmapped conversations fall back to `claude.work_dir`.

---

## Step 5 – Run

```bash
./lazycoding config.yaml
```

For persistent background operation:

```bash
# tmux (recommended for development)
tmux new -s lazycoding
./lazycoding config.yaml

# nohup
nohup ./lazycoding config.yaml >> lazycoding.log 2>&1 &
```

**systemd service (Linux production):**

```ini
# /etc/systemd/system/lazycoding.service
[Unit]
Description=lazycoding Telegram–Claude gateway
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
WorkingDirectory=/opt/lazycoding
ExecStart=/opt/lazycoding/lazycoding /opt/lazycoding/config.yaml
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=5

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

```bash
systemctl enable --now lazycoding
journalctl -fu lazycoding
```

---

## Feishu setup

Feishu uses a webhook model instead of long polling. The bot must be reachable from Feishu's servers (a public IP or a tunnel like ngrok/frp).

### Step 1 – Create a Feishu app

1. Go to [open.feishu.cn/app](https://open.feishu.cn/app) → **Create app** → choose **Custom app**
2. Note the **App ID** and **App Secret** from the **Credentials & Basic Info** tab
3. Under **Permissions** → add `im:message` (receive/send messages) and `im:message.group_at_msg` for group bots
4. Under **Event Subscriptions** → set the request URL to `http://<your-host>:8080/feishu`
   - Enable event: `im.message.receive_v1` (receive messages)
   - Enable event: `im.message.action.trigger_v1` (receive card button clicks)
5. Under **Bot** tab → enable the bot feature

### Step 2 – Configure lazycoding for Feishu

```yaml
feishu:
  app_id: "cli_xxxxxxxxxx"
  app_secret: "your-app-secret"
  webhook_path: "/feishu"   # default
  listen_addr: ":8080"      # default
  encrypt_key: ""           # optional AES event encryption key

claude:
  work_dir: "/Users/yourname/projects/my-project"
  timeout_sec: 900

log:
  format: "text"
  level: "info"
```

When `feishu.app_id` is set, lazycoding starts an HTTP server and handles Feishu webhooks instead of Telegram polling.

### Step 3 – Expose the webhook

Feishu must be able to reach your machine:

```bash
# Option A: If your server has a public IP
# Just make sure port 8080 is open

# Option B: Local dev with ngrok
ngrok http 8080
# Set the forwarding URL (https://xxxx.ngrok.io/feishu) in the Feishu app console

# Option C: frp or any reverse proxy
```

### Step 4 – Run

```bash
./lazycoding config.yaml
# Feishu sends a URL verification request on startup
# You'll see: "feishu webhook listening addr=:8080 path=/feishu"
```

---

## Interactive features

### Inline cancel button

Every response starts with a `⏳ thinking…` placeholder and a **[✕ Cancel]** button. Click it at any point to abort — session history is preserved, the message queue is cleared.

```
Bot: ⏳ thinking…   [✕ Cancel]
     ↓ click
Bot: ⏹ Cancelled.
```

### Quick-reply buttons

When Claude's response ends with a question, **[✅ Yes]** / **[❌ No]** buttons appear automatically. One tap sends your reply.

```
Bot: Should I also update the unit tests?
     [✅ Yes]  [❌ No]

You: [tap Yes]
Bot: ⏳ thinking…
```

### Message queuing

Messages sent while Claude is busy are queued — nothing is dropped, nothing is cancelled automatically. Claude works through them in order.

```
You: Analyse this file
Bot: ⏳ thinking…

You: (Claude is still running) Also check the dependencies
Bot: ⏳ Queued — will run after the current task.

Bot: Analysis: …
Bot: ⏳ thinking…   ← starts the queued request
Bot: Dependencies: …
```

### Tool call display

As Claude works, each tool call is shown inline with a human-readable summary instead of raw JSON:

```
🔧 Read: src/payment/handler.go
🔧 Edit: src/payment/handler.go
🔧 Bash: go test ./...
🔧 AskUserQuestion: Should I also update the integration tests?
🔧 TodoWrite: (3 todos)
```

File paths are shown relative to the work directory. The same formatting is used in the terminal verbose log.

---

## Voice input

Send a Telegram voice message; the bot transcribes it and forwards the text to Claude.

| Option | Backend value | Prerequisite | Privacy |
|--------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| **A: Groq API** (recommended) | `groq` | Free API key | Cloud |
| B: whisper-native (CGo) | `whisper-native` | `brew install whisper-cpp` + `-tags whisper` | Local |
| C: whisper.cpp CLI | `whisper-cpp` | `brew install whisper-cpp` | Local |
| D: openai-whisper | `whisper` | `pip install openai-whisper` | Local |

### Option A: Groq API (recommended, zero install)

Register at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) → API Keys → Create key, then:

```yaml
transcription:
  enabled: true
  backend: "groq"
  groq:
    api_key: "gsk_your_key_here"
    model: "whisper-large-v3-turbo"
    language: "en"   # leave empty for auto-detect
```

Free tier: **28,800 seconds/day** (~8 hours). Accepts OGG natively.

### Option B: whisper-native (embedded, no subprocess)

```bash
brew install whisper-cpp ffmpeg
go build -tags whisper -o lazycoding ./cmd/lazycoding/
```

```yaml
transcription:
  enabled: true
  backend: "whisper-native"
  whisper_native:
    model: "base"   # auto-downloaded to ~/.cache/lazycoding/whisper/
    language: "en"
```

### Option C: whisper.cpp CLI

```bash
brew install whisper-cpp
whisper-download-ggml-model base
```

```yaml
transcription:
  enabled: true
  backend: "whisper-cpp"
  whisper_cpp:
    bin: "whisper-cli"
    model: "/opt/homebrew/share/whisper-cpp/models/ggml-base.bin"
    language: "en"
```

### Model reference

| Model | Size | Speed | Best for |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| `tiny` | 75 MB | very fast | Short phrases, English |
| `base` | 140 MB | fast | **Recommended starting point** |
| `small` | 460 MB | medium | Technical terminology |
| `medium` | 1.5 GB | slow | High accuracy |
| `large-v3-turbo` | 809 MB | medium | High accuracy + speed |

---

## File upload

Drop any file or photo into the Telegram conversation. lazycoding saves it to the project directory and tells Claude it's there.

```
You: [upload requirements.txt]
     caption: Write a Dockerfile for this

Bot: 🔧 Read: requirements.txt
     Here is the Dockerfile: …
```

- Caption becomes the Claude prompt; you can also upload silently and ask in a follow-up message
- Photos → `photo_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.jpg`
- Directory components in filenames are stripped (path traversal prevention)

---

## File download

Retrieve any file from the project directory:

```
/download src/main.go
/download dist/app.tar.gz
```

Paths are relative to the conversation's work directory.

```
You: Write a data-processing script, save as process.py
Bot: Done, created process.py

You: /download process.py
Bot: [sends process.py]
```

---

## Advanced configuration

### Multiple users sharing one bot

```yaml
telegram:
  allowed_user_ids:
    - 111111111   # you
    - 222222222   # colleague A
    - 333333333   # colleague B
```

Leave `allowed_user_ids` empty to allow everyone. One conversation = one Claude process; incoming messages queue automatically.

### Specify the Claude model

```yaml
# Global default
claude:
  extra_flags:
    - "--model"
    - "claude-sonnet-4-6"

# Per-conversation override
channels:
  "-1001234567890":
    work_dir: "/projects/important"
    extra_flags:
      - "--model"
      - "claude-opus-4-6"
```

### Timeout

```yaml
claude:
  timeout_sec: 900   # 15 min; increase for very long tasks
```

### Terminal conversation log

```yaml
log:
  verbose: true
```

Prints a real-time, human-readable transcript to stderr:

```
15:04:05 ▶ conv=123456789  user:7846572322
  Refactor the payment module

15:04:07   🔧 Read  {"file_path":"/projects/api/payment.go"}
15:04:09   🔧 Edit  {"file_path":"/projects/api/payment.go",...
15:04:15 ◀ CLAUDE
  Done. Extracted PaymentService into its own struct, added
  interface, updated 3 call sites.
```

### Persistent sessions

Claude session IDs survive bot restarts. They are saved to `~/.lazycoding/sessions.json` automatically — no configuration needed. After a restart, each conversation resumes from exactly where it left off.

Sessions are keyed by **work directory path**. Multiple Telegram conversations pointing at the same project (for example, your phone and your desktop client in separate chats) automatically share a single Claude session, and their requests are serialised so they never overlap.

When lazycoding has no stored session for a work directory, it automatically scans `~/.claude/projects/` for sessions left by the local Claude Code CLI and resumes the most recently used one. This lets you start a task in the terminal and seamlessly continue it from Telegram (or vice versa). If lazycoding already has a stored session for that directory, it takes priority — run `/reset` to clear it and let auto-discovery pick up the latest local session.

### JSON logging

```yaml
log:
  format: "json"
  level: "info"
```

## FAQ

**Q: No response after sending a message**
→ Check `allowed_user_ids` contains your user\_id (or leave it empty)
→ Check the terminal for error logs
→ Verify `claude` is in PATH: `which claude`

**Q: "Error starting Claude" reply**
```bash
cd /your/work_dir
claude --print "hello" --output-format stream-json --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

**Q: YAML parse error on a negative chat\_id**
→ Must be quoted: `"-1001234567890":` not `-1001234567890:`

**Q: Task timed out (signal: killed)**
→ Increase `claude.timeout_sec` in config.yaml. Default is 900 s (15 min).
→ The Claude session is still saved; send a follow-up like "continue" to resume.

**Q: Voice message says "Voice transcription is not enabled"**
→ Set `transcription.enabled: true` and configure a backend (Groq is easiest):
```yaml
transcription:
  enabled: true
  backend: "groq"
  groq:
    api_key: "gsk_..."
```

**Q: "command not found: whisper-cli"**
→ `brew install whisper-cpp` then confirm with `which whisper-cli`

**Q: whisper-cpp OGG format error**
→ `brew install ffmpeg` (auto-used for conversion)
→ Or switch to Groq backend (accepts OGG natively)

**Q: Where did my uploaded file go?**
→ Saved in the conversation's `work_dir`. Run `/workdir` to see the path.

**Q: /download says "File not found"**
→ Path is relative to `work_dir`:
```
work_dir:  /projects/myapp
file:      /projects/myapp/src/main.go
command:   /download src/main.go
```

**Q: whisper-native build fails**
→ `brew install whisper-cpp` then `go build -tags whisper ./cmd/lazycoding/`

**Q: Session lost after restart**
→ Sessions are stored in `~/.lazycoding/sessions.json` automatically and survive restarts. If the file is missing or corrupt, a fresh session is started. Sessions are also keyed by work directory, so multiple Telegram conversations pointing at the same project automatically share one Claude session.

**Q: Can I share a Claude session between the local CLI and Telegram?**
→ Yes. When lazycoding has no stored session for a work directory, it automatically discovers the most recently used session from `~/.claude/projects/` and resumes it. This means you can:
  - Work locally in the terminal → switch to Telegram and continue the same context
  - Work from Telegram → then `claude --resume <session-id>` locally (session ID visible via `/session`)

If lazycoding already has a stored session, that takes priority. Run `/reset` to clear it and let auto-discovery pick up the latest local session.

Note: do not use both simultaneously (local CLI + Telegram) for the same session; two concurrent invocations writing to the same session can produce unpredictable results.

**Q: How do I switch Claude models mid-session?**
→ Use `/model claude-opus-4-6` (or any Claude model ID). The override is stored per session and takes effect on the next message. Use `/model` with no arguments to see the current model. `/reset` clears the override along with the session history.

**Q: How do I see token usage and cost?**
→ Send `/cost`. Usage is accumulated from every Claude turn in the session and persists across bot restarts. The cost figure comes directly from Claude Code's own accounting.

**Q: Can I check what Claude is doing mid-task?**
→ Yes — send `/status` at any time. The bot replies with the current tool call list and any text Claude has produced so far, identical to what is shown in the live placeholder message.

**Q: Can I use Feishu instead of Telegram?**
→ Yes. Set `feishu.app_id` and `feishu.app_secret` in config.yaml (and remove or leave blank `telegram.token`). lazycoding automatically selects the Feishu adapter. The bot uses interactive cards for streaming output instead of Telegram's edit-in-place messages.

**Q: Can I run both Telegram and Feishu at the same time?**
→ Not with a single process. Run two separate instances with separate config files, pointing to the same session file if you want shared context.

**Q: "Session contains expired thinking-block signatures" error**
→ This happens when Claude's extended thinking session has expired signature data. Send `/reset` to start a fresh session.
